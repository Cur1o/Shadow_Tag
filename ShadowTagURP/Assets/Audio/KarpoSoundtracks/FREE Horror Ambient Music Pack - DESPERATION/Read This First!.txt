Thank you for downloading my FREE Horror Ambient Music Pack - DESPERATION!
This pack contains 3 unique tracks, 11 minutes of original music and 4 loopable files!


These tracks make for very disturbing and scary atmospheres that you can use FOR FREE in your game.

This pack is what you need for that final touch for your horror game, or is ALL you need for that mini horror game you've been building recently, and I'm happy to be a part of it!

--
If you release your game or have an early version containing music from this pack, I would LOVE to play & share it.
Feel free to hit me on my email with your game so I can share it with my audience!


If you have any questions or would like to hire me to compose custom music for your game, 
or just want to chat, or tell me what kind of music pack you'd like me to release next, you can reach me at:

Best regards, Karpo.
